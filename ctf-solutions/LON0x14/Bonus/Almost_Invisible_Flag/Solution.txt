Data is hidden inside the image (stenography)

1. Open the image in gimp
2. Use magic want tool with very low tolerance and select top left pixel
3. Fill with black, notice the many squares and stripes seft in the original colour. If converted from binary to ascii, the top two rows spell "PK" indicating that it's a zip file.
4. Invert selection and fill with white
4. Export the image as pnm file - this is uncompressed and bytes are in a logical order (we got a hint for this)
5. Open file in hex editor
6. Replace blocks of 9 FF bytes with byte for ASCII "0"
7. Replace blocks of 3 FF bytes with byte for ASCII "1"
8. Replace all 00 bytes with nothing - You now have a file containing binary for a zip file, represented as ascii
9. Convert the ascii 1s and 0s to binary by piping it to this perl-fu: perl -lpe '$_=pack"B*",$_' and redirecting the output to a file.
10. Open zip file and find flag
